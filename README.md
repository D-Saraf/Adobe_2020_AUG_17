	----------------------------------------------------------------------

	What is OOP?
		Object Oriented Programming
			==> Writing your code which resemble real world.
			Tv, AC, mobile, laptop are examples of real world objects

			we communicate with Objects by sending messages
			 I need to understand what the message does/ Don;t need to know how it is working



			 Messages ==> Functions / Actions

		SOLID Design Principle
		----------------------

			S ==> Single Responsibility

			O ==> Open Close Principle

				Objects should be open for extension and closed for Change.

				void sort(....) {

				}

			L ==> Liskov Substitution Principle

				  Relationship between objects [ Generalization and Specialization]	

				  	Pen and Marker Pen

				  	Pen is generalized form
				  	Marker Pen is a specialied Pen

				  	Marker Pen should do all that a Pen does [ all the capabilites] + it can achieve more

			I ==> Interface segregation

				Objects should have multiple interfaces

				Banking application [ Service object]: Manager has different interface, customer has different interface

			D ==> Dependency Injection
				Inversion Of Control

				Object to communicate with database
					==> They write code to establish database connection

				DI: --> connection is injected into your object
